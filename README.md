# Ravenous
React project built through CA Intensive

This is a sample project build while enrolled in Codecademy's front-end application intensive program. 
It is built using React and is designed to handle simple requests to the Yelp API.

Functionality to query the API for user reviews was added in addition to the original project functionality.
